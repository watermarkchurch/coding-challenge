# Cursor Rules

## Layout Preferences

When designing UI layouts, prefer stretching content to use available space rather than compressing it into a narrow centered column. This means:

1. Use wider max-width containers (prefer max-w-6xl over max-w-4xl)
2. Allow forms and content to use full width of their containers
3. Use grid and flex layouts that expand to fill space
4. Only center content when it specifically improves readability (like very long text paragraphs)
5. Maintain consistent padding and spacing at container edges
6. Use responsive design to ensure content remains readable at all screen sizes

This creates more spacious, modern layouts that make better use of available screen real estate while maintaining visual hierarchy and readability.
